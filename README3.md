1. Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to dive deep into two fundamental concepts: URLs and Forms. In the process, we are going to explore many other concepts like creating reusable templates and installing third-party libraries. We are also going to write plenty of unit tests.

2. URLs

    2.1 We will start by editing the urls.py

3. Reusables Templates. In this section we are going to refactor our HTML templates, creating a master page and only adding the unique part for each template.

    Create a new file named base.html in the templates folder

4. Form. Forms are used to deal with user input. It’s a very common task in any web application or website. The standard way to do it is through HTML forms, where the user input some data, submit it to the server, and then the server does something with it.

Conclusions

In this tutorial, we focused on URLs, Reusable Templates, and Forms. As usual, we also implement several test cases. That’s how we develop with confidence.
